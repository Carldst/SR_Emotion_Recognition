TP Social Robotics LAB - Emotion Recognition using KNN algorithms.
This is a scholar work with CÃ©lestin HERNANDEZ.

In this lab, we've created a KNN algorithms to recognize emotions :
angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, suprise.
in the main.py you have the code and archive is a bunch of picture 48x48 greyscale
faces from kaggle.

I've tried some values of k to find the best :
k=3, 21.67% 
k=5, 25%
k=6, 37.66%
k=7, 40%
k=8, 31.66%
this pecentages may vary because test image are taken randomly

I tried to comment my code as much as possible but if you have any 
questions : carl.de-sousa-trias@telecom-sudparis.eu
